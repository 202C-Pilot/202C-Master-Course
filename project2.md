## Project 2: Internet Resource GuideThrough this assignment, you will become familiar with online communication resources specific to your field of study, including research tools, professional societies, and other Internet sites that members of your field find useful. You will present and describe those resources to other members of your field in a technical guide. You will need to make decisions about organization, format, and style as a means of creating a usable document for readers. And you will need to learn to write effective abstracts.This assignment asks you to identify and describe key Internet resources in your field for an audience of other people in your field (i.e., specialist to specialist communication). Organize and format this information so that others can use Internet resources for research by following your guide.## Objectives- To become familiar with specific and good resources used by professionals in your field.
- To identify possible sources of information for other 202C assignments.
- To make decisions about organization, format, and style as a means of creating a usable document for readers. 
- To develop skills with writing abstracts.## Resources to Identify in the Guide1.	Identify at least one index to the periodical literature in your major field (remember, this should be an electronic index). You can access such indexes through the E-Resources section of the library website. 2.	Identify one professional journal in your field that is available online and cite its specific strengths and uses. 3.	Use the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications to locate a report published by a government agency that relates to your field. Describe the Catalog and its use. Locate the report, provide the bibliographic data, and use it as an example of what the catalog can identify. Include a 1-2 sentence description of the report.4.	Describe the Statistical Abstract of the United States as a reference tool (it is both in print and online, so be sure to use the online version). Explain how to use the abstracts by using an example of a subject to investigate that is relevant to your field. 5.	Identify four Internet sites that are relevant to your field. Choose from the following categories of information (or propose other relevant categories of information to me):>- directory of information sources/portals
>- potential employers and job search services
>- sample reports/documents/research studies
>- news services>- government documents	
>- discussion groups, chat rooms>- patents and intellectual property
>- information on professional associations
>- specialized dictionary	
>- encyclopedia>- biographical reference	
>- handbook>- subject guide to the literature
>- bibliography	## Information to Include about the ResourcesFor each resource that you identify, provide identifying information (title, URL, etc.). Also describe the resource in an abstract so that readers will understand its general function and its specific scope. (For example, your paragraph on the index should tell both the purpose of the index and the range and dates of periodicals covered.)In writing abstracts, assume readers will ask the following questions: - What is this? 
- What is in it (content, scope)?
- How is the information relevant and useful for someone in my field? 
- What tips can help someone use the resource efficiently? ## General InformationProvide information about your guide and its use in an introduction. (In technical communication, an introduction is often called front matter.) Consider introducing each section of the guide if readers will not understand why and how to use a type of resource. Be sure to cover these areas in your front matter (you can use them as headings if you want to):- Cover/Title Page- Front Matter
>- Table of Contents (to at least two levels)>- What’s in the Guide (contents/scope)>- Who the Guide is for (audience/purpose)>- What the Guide assumes users know>- How the Guide is organized for use>- Tips for using the Guide## Evaluation Criteria I will evaluate the guides according to these expectations:	- **Content:** The guide is complete (it includes all the information requested), and the sources identified are current and significant.- **Format and Organization:** Readers will be able to find the information they need. Related materials are grouped. The guide is “usable.” 
- **Style:** Abstracts give specific information in efficient sentences.- **Audience Adaptation:** The guide offers explanatory material or instructions where necessary to help the designated audience conduct research through the internet.- **Mechanics:** Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are correct.
