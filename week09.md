## Organizing Your Information

You have probably discussed the challenges of organizing information in other courses and even in your draft reviews for this course. But techniques of organizing information are complex, and reviewing them is a worthwhile activity, especially because such techniques are central to technical communication. Readers fail to see good ideas when they are poorly organized. Strong organization will not only clarify your ideas but also help you persuade your audience.

This week you'll think explicitly about organizing information as you finalize your Job Application Package. Each document&mdash;cover memo, cover letters, and resumes&mdash;requires appropriate and compelling organizational structure. You will not necessarily use the same structures across the three documents, and some documents may use multiple organizing structures. A key task for this week is to review the ways you have organized your information. Be sure to use rhetorical and/or logical patterns that are congruent with your rhetorical context and goals. That is, be sure to consider organization rhetorically&mdash;what effect will a given organization have on your reader?

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* explain the basic principles of organizing technical information;
* choose the best pattern of organizing information given a document's specific audience and purpose; and
* choose the best patterns of organization for each part of your Job Application Package.
