## Writing Technical Definitions and Descriptions

This lesson combines two important elements of technical communication: definition and description. Although you will sometimes encounter these elements separately, more often than not they are used together to help explain an object or a process. The project we'll begin this week will ask you to focus on description, but there will be opportunities for definitional work as well.

People generally have little trouble with parenthetical definitions, single words or short phrases that provide clarification. Sentence definitions, however, are more difficult because they require a more formal structure of categorization. Many people find it difficult to choose an appropriate category for the term they are defining. The problem is that they either cannot choose a sufficiently narrow category to make the distinguishing characteristics meaningful or are so used to sliding into the definition without a noun in the category ("A cell phone is what is used . . .") that they cannot understand the concept of using a category. Extended definitions usually give people little trouble because they are less formal than sentence definitions. If you have a good grasp of paragraphing and understand the subject being defined, the extended definition will come fairly easily.

Descriptions of objects and processes encompass definition but also other writing elements. Most writers find it fairly simple to gather all the information they need to write an effective introduction to a description. Sometimes, however, they have trouble deciding just how much information their audience and purpose requires. A related difficulty is that they sometimes answer the five basic questions discussed in the chapter in separate sentences. The cause of this problem is easy to understand: they want to make sure all the necessary information is included. They worry less about the style of the description.

If you understand how to write an effective introduction, you should have little trouble with the part-by-part or step-by-step description because it involves the same process. Two problems sometimes occur, however. Some writers fail to distinguish major items from minor items. For example, a student might write a description of a bicycle that contains an unnecessarily elaborate description of the seat: the material it is made of, the type of hardware, the method of adjusting its height, and so forth. The second common problem is some students' inability to properly sequence an item-by-item description. Sometimes, they fail to follow through on the operational sequence of the mechanism or process. This can also be a problem in the conclusion of an item-by-item description, which may fail to match the rest of the description in terms of sequence or identification of major items. Paying attention to these potential problems as you write should result in a more effective description.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* explain the role of definitions and descriptions in various kinds of technical communication;
* use an understanding of a technical document's audience and purpose to select effective kinds of definitions and descriptions to write;
* write effective parenthetical, sentence, and extended definitions;
* identify the most effective place for a definition based on a document's audience and purpose; and
* write an effective description of an object or a process.
