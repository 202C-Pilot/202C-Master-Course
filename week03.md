## Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose

This lesson amplifies two characteristics of technical communication that you learned about in the previous lesson: technical communication addresses particular readers (audience) and helps readers solve problems (purpose). Understanding audience and purpose is critical to any technical communication task. 

Audience analysis, a basic principle of rhetoric for centuries, is considered today by many researchers and teachers to be the bedrock of technical communication. Many students have not thought much about the concept of audience because they have never had to consider it. Almost all of their writing has been directed to a single audience, not to multiple audiences. Typically, that audience has been the instructor. Unlike real audiences, the teacher has almost invariably known more about the subject than has the writer, thus making the writing situation even more unrealistic. In this course, your teacher will not always be your audience, and the sample documents you analyze were not written for your teacher. In other words, you are being asked to engage authentic writing situations with real audiences.

You might also find purpose to be a challenging concept. Most students have had only one main purpose in all their writing: to show sufficient knowledge or skill to earn a high grade in an academic course. Students often consider writing to be an audition, not a useful or necessary communication of ideas and information. However, as you will see in this course, writing is an integral part of day-to-day work, not an obstacle to that work.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* recognize the importance of analyzing audience and purpose when planning a document;
* identify individual characteristics of an audience or multiple audiences; and
* write text to meet the needs of expert, technician, manager, and general reader audiences.
