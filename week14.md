## Creating Graphics

Very few people have formal training in graphic design, but graphic design has become a central feature of technical communication. Nearly every technical communication document has a graphical element. Graphics both reinforce ideas and sometimes convey ideas in a unique way. For these reasons, you need to have at least a basic understanding of how to both create and use graphics. You also need to understand the ethical dimensions involved in graphic design.

There are typically three problems involved in beginning graphic design. First, one of the principal difficulties that people encounter in using graphics is, ironically, a verbal problem: they forget to explain, in the text of the document, what the graphic means. Your graphics will be more effective if they are accompanied by textual explanation. Second, many students do not know the basics of drawing graphics, such as the importance of measuring the increments carefully on an axis or of beginning axes at zero if at all possible. You will need to know how to choose the appropriate kind of graphic and have a process for creating graphics. Third, there are design problems inherent in the graphic templates in spreadsheet graphics. These graphics tend to be cluttered and distracting to readers. You may need to simplify the graphics that get created automatically by software programs.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* describe the functions of graphics;
* integrate graphics and text effectively;
* cite graphics used in technical documents; and
* choose appropriate graphics for your Instruction Set project.
