## Designing Documents

For most students in technical communication, learning about design is interesting because they haven't thought about design much or at all, even though designed documents saturate both workplace and popular contexts. Once you start to look for design elements, they seem to be everywhere. It's impossible to visit a web page without confronting information design; it's impossible to use a form without confronting information design; it's impossible to use your cell phone or iPod without confronting information design.

Probably because of your exposure to advertising, you are intuitively aware of a wide variety of design strategies. But awareness is not enough. Technical communicators today need to know how to craft more than words. Although writing remains a key task, every document needs to be designed in a way that helps readers both understand and use information. Design principles like proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast give you a vocabulary and skill set for creating and evaluating the design of technical documents.

Glancing at a few pages from some software manuals or government reports will show a variety of strategies, and a broad range of creativity. Design is not simply an ornamental aspect of technical communication, but a meaningful feature that aids readers in key ways.

The principles you learn about in this lesson will apply not only to your Technical Description, but also to future assignments and all other technical communication work. In sum, design is as important as content in technical communication.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* evaluate technical documents using the principles of proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast;
* plan the design of a technical communication document based on audience needs and expectations;
* explain the principles of chunking, queuing, and filtering;
* use columns, page grids, and white space to design a document's page layout;
* define common typographical elements;
* apply principles of typography to design an effective document;
* design titles and headings so that they are visually distinct;
* describe the uses of rules, boxes, screens, marginal glosses, and pull quotes in technical documents; and
* apply document design principles to your Technical Description project.
