## Class Discussion 1

Since we'll be working together as a community of writers this semester, it behooves us to begin by getting to know each other. For this class discussion, tell us a little about yourself, like

* Where are you from?
* What are your career interests?
* What are your hobbies?
* What do you hope to gain from this class?

Then, once you've introduced yourself to the class, connect with your classmates by responding to their introductions. Feel free to talk about shared interests, experiences, and/or concerns. Remember, we're all in this together.
