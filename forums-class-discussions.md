## Class Discussion 1. No Reading.

Since we'll be working together as a community of writers this semester, it behooves us to begin by getting to know each other. For this class discussion, tell us a little about yourself, like

* Where are you from?
* What are your career interests?
* What are your hobbies?
* What do you hope to gain from this class?

Then, once you've introduced yourself to the class, connect with your classmates by responding to their introductions. Feel free to talk about shared interests, experiences, and/or concerns. Remember, we're all in this together.

## Class Discussion 3. Reading: Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose

Before beginning to write, writers should analyze their audience and purpose. Who are you writing for? What do they need to know? Why should they care? And what are you hoping to achieve by writing for them? If you don't have answers to these kinds of questions, then how can you know how best to compose, design, and deliver your message? This class discussion asks you to focus on the importance of audience and purpose in the writing process.
