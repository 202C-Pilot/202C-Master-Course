## Class Discussion 1. No Reading.

Since we'll be working together as a community of writers this semester, let's begin by getting to know each other. For this class discussion, tell us about yourself:

* Where are you from?
* What are your career interests?
* What do you hope to gain from this class?
* What are your hobbies?

Then, once you've introduced yourself to the class, connect with your classmates by responding to their introductions. Feel free to talk about shared interests, experiences, and/or concerns. Remember, we're all in this together.

## Class Discussion 2. Reading: Defining Technical Communication

## Class Discussion 3. Reading: Analyzing Your Audience and Purpose

Before beginning to write, writers should analyze their audience and purpose. Who are you writing for? What do they need to know? Why should they care?
