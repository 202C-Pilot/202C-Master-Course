## Class Discussion 1. No Reading.

Since we'll be working together as a community of writers this semester, it behooves us to begin by getting to know each other. For this class discussion, tell us a little about yourself, like

* Where are you from?
* What are your career interests?
* What are your hobbies?
* What do you hope to gain from this class?

Then, once you've introduced yourself to the class, connect with your classmates by responding to their introductions. Feel free to talk about shared interests, experiences, and/or concerns. Remember, we're all in this together.

## Class Discussion 2. Reading: Defining Technical Communication

Whether you realize it or not, you probably encounter technical writing nearly everyday in the world around you. That table of nutritional information on the side of your cereal box? That's technical writing!

This class discussion is designed to help you understand what technical writing is, how it differs from other forms of writing, and how to recognize it in your everyday life.</p>

Using the language and concepts of this lesson's reading, compose a substantive discussion post that addresses some or all of the prompts below. Because we're looking to foster discussion here, try to end your post with a question or two for your classmates to consider.

Prompts for Discussion

* What is Technical Writing? Why does it matter?
* How does technical writing differ from other kinds of writing, such as academic or creative writing?
* What kinds of technical writing have you seen before? What concepts and strategies seem to be important in these forms of technical communication?
* What are some examples of technical writing you encounter in your everyday life besides the usual suspects (e.g. resumes, instructions, reports, etc.)? What makes them technical writing?
