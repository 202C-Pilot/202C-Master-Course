## Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations

This lesson will introduce ethical and legal issues that technical communicators need to consider when preparing both written and online documents.

In one sense, it is very difficult to talk about the ethics of technical communication because the subject is subtle and complicated and there are no easy answers. Indeed, the majority of technical communication situations will contain more gray area than easy, straightforward solutions. Because most students have experienced serious ethical dilemmas at school or at work, you already have a background for thinking about ethical matters. But experience is not enough. You also need training to help you recognize and understand ethical dilemmas in technical communication.

Sometimes people want to be told what they should do when they confront ethical dilemmas. Sometimes students think that reading a chapter on ethics will make them ethical people. But you cannot learn how to be ethical. Rather, you need to understand how ethicists frame issues so that you can think about your own ethical issues more clearly and sensitively. In other words, being ethical involves ongoing work on a process of reasoning that accounts for the many factors in any ethical situation.

Discussions of legal considerations are similarly challenging because workers do not necessarily see themselves as being representatives of their organizations. But when employees communicate, they represent the ethical stance of their organizations, and this ethical stance is often a matter of legal concern. You need to learn to see that the law is our society's principal means of manifesting its deepest ethical beliefs. Often there are liability cases that focus our attention on the relationship between ethics and the law. For example, an image of a child operating a small appliance implies that children can use the appliance safely. This implication has an ethical dimension: at what age should children operate the appliance? It would be easy to employ an image in which the age of a child was difficult to discern. The image also has a legal dimension: the company may be held responsible for injury.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* explain why technical communicators need to understand basic ethical and legal principles;
* define whistleblowing;
* examine the ethical implications of your own writing and communication.
