## Writing Effective Sentences

All of your projects, including the current one, ask you to consider textual aspects of your document. This task includes rewriting sentences so that they are more effective for their intended readers and purposes. Although this course has emphasized larger concerns like design, organization, and ethics, technical communicators still need to be able to write clear and effective sentences. This lesson will provide you with strategies you can use in both drafting original work and revising existing work.

Writing effective sentences requires you to think about the writing situation. For example, if a writer is addressing a non-expert audience, a series of relatively short sentences might be most appropriate even though the writer might personally prefer longer, more complex sentences. Another example relates to translation. If your text is likely to be translated into another language, avoiding jokes, puns, and culture-bound references is a good idea. It's also a good idea to use the active voice and to use pronouns carefully. Such sentence-level considerations should be based on your understanding of the writing situation.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* structure effective sentences;
* choose the right words and phrases;
* prepare texts for translation; and
* apply the techniques for creating effective sentences to your Instruction Set project.
