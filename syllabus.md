## Course Overview

ENGL 202C, Technical Communication, serves students who are studying and preparing for careers in the sciences and applied sciences, including engineering. This advanced course in writing familiarizes students with the discourse practices prized in their disciplinary and institutional communities and helps them to manage those practices effectively in their own written work. In this way the course teaches those writing strategies and tactics that scientists, engineers, and others will need in order to write successfully on the job.

So how will this work? Though you will never meet with your instructor and classmates in a physical classroom, this is still a course and not an independent study. This class is paced, which means that there is an established start and end date, and that you will have weekly deadlines to meet throughout the term. In each week of the course, you will be asked to participate in two primary activities: 1) a class discussion about a core aspect of technical communication and 2) a writing workshop. The class discussion will take place in the early part of the week, and the writing workshop will take place in the latter part. This routine will be repeated each week throughout the semester.

Like taking a course on campus, it will be important to keep up with the course work, as you will be required to participate in class discussions and workshops that have specific time frames and deadlines associated with them. For a more detailed look at what each lesson will entail, as well as due dates for our assignments and activities, refer to the [Weekly Activities][5] page.

## Course Objectives

Students in this course will learn how to:

* Discover and understand the discourse features that distinguish their disciplinary and institutional communities from others.
* Discover and specify the purpose(s) of their writing.
* Develop a range of writing processes appropriate to various writing tasks.
* Identify their readers and describe the characteristics of their readers in a way that forms a sound basis for deciding how to write to them.
* Invent the contents of their communications through research and reflection.
* Arrange material to raise and satisfy readers' expectations, using both conventional and rhetorical patterns of organization.
* Reveal the organization of their communications by using forecasting and transitional statements, headings, and effective page and document design.
* Observe appropriate generic conventions and formats for technical documents.
* Design and use tables, graphs, illustrations, and other visuals.
* Compose effective sentences.
* Evaluate their documents to be sure that the documents fulfill their purpose and to ensure that they can be revised if necessary.
* Collaborate effectively with their peers in a community of writers who provide feedback on each others' work and occasionally write together.
* Write several specific kinds of documents that recur in technical, scientific, and other communities.
* Employ computer technologies effectively in the solution of communication problems.
* Communicate in an ethically responsible manner.

## Course Requirements and Grading

You will complete five projects for this course, participate in weekly class discussions, and complete weekly writing workshops.

|  Assignment         | Grade Value |
|---                  |---          |
| Project 1           | 10%         |
| Project 2           | 15%					|
| Project 3           | 15%			    |
| Project 4           | 15% 		      |
| Project 5           | 15%         |
| Class Discussions   | 15%         |
| Writing Workshops   | 15%         |

## Class Discussions and Writing Workshops 

In each week of the class, you will participate in one class discussion and one writing workshop. These discussions and workshops are where you will interact with your classmates and where you will work together to learn and grow as technical communicators. 

Each discussion and workshop is asynchronous, which means you'll never have to be available at a specific time or place to participate. Instead, you'll be given deadlines by which you'll be expected to complete various parts of each discussion or workshop.

There will be 15 class discussion forums, each worth 1% or one point, for a total of 15% of your final grade. Similarly, there will be 15 writing workshop forums, each worth 1% or one point, for a total of 15% of your final grade. Together, these class discussions and writing workshops make up nearly a third of your final grade, which reflects just how important interacting with your classmates is to this course. 

Both class discussions and writing workshops will be graded on a one point scale aimed at rewarding your work in each forum:

* 1 point for students with **excellent** work. 
* 0.75 of a point for students with **satisfactory** work.
* 0 points for students with **unsatisfactory** work or incomplete work. 

NOTE: Only completing part of a class discussion or writing workshop is considered unsatisfactory. **You will not receive points for a forum unless you complete all of its work.** 


## Projects

This course will hold you to the professional standards that prevail in your field. Each of your formal writing projects is expected to look professional and polished. At work, even a single error in spelling, grammar, or proofreading can jeopardize the effectiveness of some communications (depending on the rhetorical situation). Whether it is a resume, memo, or report, your communication should exhibit complete and appropriate format. Grading will reflect the seriousness with which these matters are frequently viewed in the working world. **You must hand in all major projects to pass the course.**

There are five major projects: 

>## Project 1, Basic Rhetorical Analysis
Technical communication is meant to be used and not just read. Good technical communication communicates information to an audience who will act on that information in a variety of ways: in making hiring decisions, in following technical procedures, in developing research plans, and more. In this project, you will evaluate the usability of a piece of technical communication; that is, you will analyze whether the document effectively communicates the necessary information to its audience and where it fails to do so. In this way, the project will introduce you to basic elements of technical communication. Final Length: Approximately 1000 words.

>## Project 2, Internet Resource Guide 
Through this project, you will become familiar with online communication resources specific to your field of study, including research tools, professional societies, and other Internet sites that members of your field should find useful. You will present and describe those resources to other members of your field in a technical guide. You will need to make decisions about organization, format, and style as a means of creating a usable document for readers. And you will need to learn to write effective abstracts. Final Length: Eight abstracts (one or two paragraphs each) plus front matter.

>## Project 3, Job Application Package  
The process of applying for a job is extremely important for technical communicators. As a job applicant, you have a vested interest in communicating your suitability for a position with the specific audience making employment decisions. This project will ask you to create resumes and cover letters attuned to the rhetorical situations of two actual job offerings in your field. You will also discuss your writing and communication decisions in a reflective memo. Final Length: Two resumes, two cover letters, and a 1000-word cover memo.

>## Project 4, Technical Description 
Engineers and scientists are often required to describe a technical object, concept, or process to someone who has little knowledge or experience with the subject at hand. For example, an engineering firm might write a proposal to bid on a contract to develop a helicopter for the Defense Department; one section of the proposal would be a detailed description of the product the company proposes to develop. Technical descriptions are used before products and processes are developed (as part of proposals and planning documents), during development (in progress reports, for instance), and afterwards (as part of marketing and promotional literature and technical support documents). You will write a technical description for an object, concept, or process in your field. Final Length: Approximately 1000 words.

>## Project 5, Instruction Set 
Instruction sets are common technical documents in many disciplines and occupations. Employees read instructions to learn how to assemble a product or complete a procedure. Supervisors write out company policies that oftentimes serve as instruction sets. Customers read instructions for using a product. You will develop a set of instructions that shows users how to perform a specific task. Final Length: Approximately 1000 words.

## Grades

The grades of A, B, C, D, and F indicate qualities of academic performance. When grading each of your projects, I will ask one overriding question: Does this document do its job successfully? That is, would your communication have the intended effect on the reader you are addressing. I will, of course, recognize the difference between a competent performance (a “C”) and good and excellent performances (“B” and “A”). A competent performance is one that stands a chance of succeeding; an excellent performance is one that seems assured not only of success but also of winning praise.

> A = Superior. The work is of near professional quality. The document meets or exceeds all the objectives of the assignment. The content is mature, thorough, and well-suited for the audience; the style is clear, accurate, and forceful; the information is well-organized and designed so that it is accessible and attractive; the mechanics and grammar are correct.

> B = Good. The document meets the objectives of the assignment, but it needs improvement in style, or it contains easily correctable errors in grammar, format, or content, or its content is superficial.

> C = Competent. The document needs significant improvement in concept, details, development, organization, grammar, or format. It may be formally correct but superficial in content.

> D = Marginally acceptable. The document meets some of the objectives but ignores others; the content is inadequately developed; or it contains numerous or major errors.

> F = Unacceptable. The document does not have enough information, does something other than the assignment required, or it contains major or excessive errors.

The following point values will be assigned to each letter grade:

| Letter Grade/ | Point Value |
|---           |---          |
| A						 | 95					 |
| A-					 | 90					 |
| B+					 | 88					 |
| B						 | 85					 |
| B-					 | 80					 |
| C+					 | 78					 |
| C						 | 75					 |
| C-					 | 70					 |
| D+					 | 68					 |
| D						 | 65					 |
| D-					 | 60					 |
| F						 | 55					 |


## Final Grading Scale

At the end of the term, the following scale will be used to determine final course grades:

| Letter Grade/ | Point Range |
|---           |---          |
| A						 | 93-100			 |
| A-					 | 90-92.99		 |
| B+					 | 88-89.99		 |
| B						 | 83-87.99		 |
| B-					 | 80-82.99		 |
| C+					 | 78-79.99		 |
| C						 | 73-77.99		 |
| C-					 | 70-72.99		 |
| D+					 | 68-69.99		 |
| D						 | 63-67.99		 |
| D-					 | 60-62.99		 |
| F						 | 0-59.99   	 |


## Deadlines

Unless otherwise specified, the work you do in this class must be submitted by 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time on the day that it is due. Class Discussions and Writing Workshops will be due weekly. Projects will be due every three weeks. For those who like to plan ahead, here's what that looks like:

* Sunday, End of Week 3 - Project 1 Due.
* Sunday, End of Week 6 - Project 2 Due.
* Sunday, End of Week 9 - Project 3 Due.
* Sunday, End of Week 12 - Project 4 Due.
* Sunday, End of Week 15 - Project 5 Due.

To see what you need to do each week and when you must do it by, refer to the [Weekly Activities][5] page.


## Late Policy

I expect projects to be completed on time, as evidenced by the date stamp given to them by the ANGEL dropboxes. Projects will be docked one full letter grade for each day after the due date that they are late; class discussions and weekly writing workshops cannot be made up if missed. I use this system even in the event of excusable situations, such as minor sicknesses or other unforeseen conflicts. However, any exceptions to this policy are made at my discretion. If you have conflicts, or something unexpected arises, do not hesitate to contact me, and we'll arrive at a solution together. You must hand in all major projects to pass the course.

## Deferred Grades

If, for reasons beyond your control, you are prevented from completing a course within the prescribed time, your grade in the course may be deferred at your instructor's discretion. When you are given a Deferred Grade, the symbol "DF" appears on your transcript until the course has been completed.

Note: Deferred Grades will only be given to students who have completed a majority of the course work.

Non-emergency requests for a deferred grade must be made before the beginning of the final examination period. In emergency situations, your instructor can approve a deferred grade after the final exam period has started. Under emergency conditions during which the instructor is unavailable, authorization is required from one of the following: the dean of the college in which the candidate is enrolled; the executive director of the Division of Undergraduate Studies if the student is enrolled in that division or is a provisional student; or the campus chancellor of the student's commonwealth campus.

For additional information please refer to the [Deferring a Grade][18] page.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity&mdash;coursework free of fraud and deception&mdash;is an important educational objective of Penn State. Academic dishonesty can lead to a failing grade or referral to the [Office of Student Conduct][7].

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:

* cheating
* plagiarism
* fabrication of information or citations
* facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others
* unauthorized prior possession of examinations
* submitting the work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor and securing written approval
* tampering with the academic work of other students

In cases where academic integrity is questioned, [procedure requires an instructor to notify a student][8] of suspected dishonesty before filing a charge and recommended sanction with the college. Procedures allow a student to accept or contest a charge. If a student chooses to contest a charge, the case will then be managed by the respective college or campus Academic Integrity Committee. If a disciplinary sanction also is recommended, the case will be referred to the [Office of Student Conduct][7]. 

All Penn State colleges abide by this Penn State policy, but review procedures may vary by college when academic dishonesty is suspected. Information about Penn State's academic integrity policy and college review procedures is included in the information that students receive upon enrolling in a course. To obtain that information in advance of enrolling in a course, please [contact us][13].

Additionally, World Campus students are expected to act with civility and personal integrity; respect other students' dignity, rights, and property; and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their own efforts. An environment of academic integrity is requisite to respect for oneself and others, and a civil community.

For more information on academic integrity at Penn State, please see the [Academic Integrity Chart][14] for specific college contact information or visit one of the following URLs:

* Penn State Senate [Policy on Academic Integrity][15]
* [iStudy for Success!][16] &mdash; learn about plagiarism, copyright, and academic integrity through an educational module
* [Turnitin][17] &mdash; a web-based plagiarism detection and prevention system

## Accommodating Disabilities

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Disability Services (ODS) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus: [ODS Disability Liaison Contact Information][19]. For further information, please visit the [Office for Disability Services][11] website. 

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation based on the [ODS documentation guidelines][20]. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

## Additional Policies

Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.

For information about additional policies regarding items such as Penn State Access Accounts; credit by examination; course tuition, fees, and refund schedules; and drops and withdrawals please see the [World Campus Student Policies][21] website.
