## Writing Activity 4 - Project 2, IRG
* Part One: Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your IRG.
* Part Two: Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on prompt responses.

The first step in drafting your Internet Resource Guide is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Guide, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goals of your responses are to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more is better. So don't hold back.

Prompts for Planning: 

1. Who is the audience for your Guide?
2. What problems of your audience might you address by preparing the Guide?
3. Under what conditions or circumstances might your audience use the Guide?
4. How might the use context affect the content and organization of the Guide?
5. How might your understanding of audience affect how you write the guide?
5. What strategies might you use to motivate or appeal to your audience?
6. What might your audience already know or have experience in that you can build on?
7. At this point, what questions do you have about the project?

Prompts for Peer Feedback:

For the Front Matter

1.	Evaluate the Table of Contents. How many levels does it include? Are those levels adequate to support readers?
2.	Describe and analyze how the front matter discusses what's in the guide (contents/scope).
3.	Describe and analyze how the front matter attends to its audience and to the purposes for which it will be used. 
4.	What does the front matter assume that the user knows? Evaluate these assumptions. 
5.	What does the front matter say about how the guide is organized for use?
6.	Does the front matter discuss tips for using the guide efficiently? Can you suggest additional tips?
7.	Evaluate the development of the front matter. Which areas might need development or revision?
8.	How does the author distinguish between the different sections of the front matter?
9.	What could be added to the front matter to make the guide and its uses clearer to the intended audience?
