## Writing Workshop 4 - Project 2, IRG
* Part One, Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your IRG.

The first step in drafting your Internet Resource Guide is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Guide, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goal of your response is to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more is better. So don't hold back.

Prompts for Planning: 

1. Who is the audience for your Guide?
2. What problems of your audience might you address by preparing the Guide?
3. Under what conditions or circumstances might your audience use the Guide?
4. How might the use context affect the content and organization of the Guide?
5. How might your understanding of audience affect how you write the Guide?
6. What strategies might you use to motivate or appeal to your audience?
7. What might your audience already know or have experience in that you can build on?
8. At this point, what questions do you have about the project?

* Part Two, Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on prompt responses.

Although document plans can be tentative and contingent, it's useful to workshop your ideas with peers, in order to get feedback on what you're thinking about doing and how you're imagining the document context. The following prompts invite you to respond to the planning work of peers. Your goal is to help peers clarify and elaborate their plans and consider aspects they might be overlooking. Be an active reviewer with the goal of helping peers improve their plans.

1. Did your peer address
2. What are the strenghts of the planning work? 
2. What are the weaknesses?
3. 
4.

## Writing Workshop 5
* Part One, Friday: Draft Submission. Complete a draft of your IRG.

* Part Two, Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on drafts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of the Front Matter, review of the Abstracts, and review of the Guide overall. You don't necessarily have to respond to each and every prompt, but you should respond, in one way or another, to a majority of them. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Front Matter

1.	Evaluate the Table of Contents. How many levels does it include? Are those levels adequate to support readers?
2.	Describe and analyze how the front matter discusses what's in the guide (contents/scope).
3.	Describe and analyze how the front matter attends to its audience and to the purposes for which it will be used. 
4.	What does the front matter assume that the user knows? Evaluate these assumptions. 
5.	What does the front matter say about how the guide is organized for use?
6.	Does the front matter discuss tips for using the guide efficiently? Can you suggest additional tips?
7.	Evaluate the development of the front matter. Which areas might need development or revision?
8.	How does the author distinguish between the different sections of the front matter?
9.	What could be added to the front matter to make the guide and its uses clearer to the intended audience?

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Abstracts

1. Evaluate the completeness of the abstracts. Are the draft abstracts complete? Do they include all identifying information (title, URL etc.)? Do they include this identifying information in a consistent way?
2. Describe the clarity of the content. Do the draft abstracts describe the resources so that readers will understand both their general function and their specific scope? (For example, your abstract on the index should tell both the purpose of the index and the range and dates of periodicals covered.)
3. Return to the issue of completeness. Do the draft abstracts answer all four of the following questions sufficiently? What is this? What is in it (contents, scope)? How is that information relevant and useful for someone in my field? What are tips for using the resource efficiently? Explain any weaknesses and discuss how your peer can improve the abstracts.
4. Consider the level of detail in the abstracts. Do the abstracts include a sufficient amount of detail? Can the writer expand the abstracts in any way? (Remember that detailed statements are better than general ones.)

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Overall Guide

1.	Are the entries current and significant?
2.	Describe how the guide is formatted and organized. Is it “usable”?
3.	Comment on the style of the writing. Do the abstracts give specific information in efficient sentences?
4.	Where should the guide offer additional explanatory material or instructions to help the designated audience conduct online research?
5.	How does the guide relate specifically to the needs of the audience?
6.	What has the author done well in the guide? What needs work?
7.	Provide at least three concrete suggestions for revision. Keep the evaluation/grading criteria in mind here.
