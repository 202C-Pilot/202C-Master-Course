## Writing Workshop 1 - Project 1, Basic Rhetorical Analysis

Part One, Due Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your Basic Rhetorical Analysis.

The first step in drafting your Basic Rhetorical Analysis is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Analysis, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goal of your response is to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more tends to be better, so don't hold back.

Prompts for Planning:

1.	When and where was the document produced?
2.	Who is the audience for the document?
3.	What is the purpose of the document?
4.	How is the document organized? 
5.	In what situations or under what conditions would a person use the document?
6.	What problems might a user of this document be trying to solve?

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on responses to the planning prompts.

Although document plans can be tentative and contingent, it's useful to workshop your ideas with peers, in order to get feedback on what you're thinking about doing and how you're imagining the document context. The following prompts invite you to respond to the planning work of peers. Your goal is to help peers clarify and elaborate their plans and consider aspects they might be overlooking. Be an active reviewer, with the goal of helping peers improve their plans and projects.

1. How would you describe the project and its context for your peer?
2. What are the strengths of the planning work? What did your peer do well?
3. What are the weaknesses of the planning work? What needs to be improved?
4. How, exactly, can your peer improve their planning? What concrete suggestions for improvement can you make?

## Writing Workshop 2

Part One, Due Friday: Draft Submission. Complete a draft of your Basic Rhetorical Analysis.

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on drafts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of the Basic Rhetorical Analysis. You don't necessarily have to respond to each and every prompt, but you should respond, in one way or another, to a majority of them. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

Prompts for Peer Feedback

1. How does your peer organize their analysis? Is it organized in a logical manner? 
2. How does the organization highlight (rather than subordinate) the most important points of analysis? Or does it fail to do so?
3. How does the writer transition between ideas? Do the transitions need work?
4. How does your peer support their claims about the document?
5. What specific examples do they use? What makes the examples sufficient and compelling? If they are not, which sections need more or better support?
6. Does your peer analyze, and not just describe, the document?
7. Where is this analysis sufficient and where might it need revision?
8. What, if any, areas of the document are under-analyzed or merely described?
9. Does the draft follow a memo format? 
10. Does each paragraph contain a strong topic sentence?
11. How does the document use headings and subheadings to organize ideas? Are these sufficient?
12. Is the document free of stylistic and grammatical errors?

Prompts for Reflection

1. How did the project go?
2. What did you learn from doing the project?
3. What areas of the project are you pleased with? Why?
4. What areas of the project could be improved? Why?

2. Describe the clarity of the content. Do the draft abstracts describe the resources so that readers will understand both their general function and their specific scope? (For example, your abstract on the index should tell both the purpose of the index and the range and dates of the periodicals covered.)
3. Return to the issue of completeness. Do the draft abstracts answer all four of the following questions sufficiently: What is this? What is in it (contents, scope)? How is that information relevant and useful for someone in my field? What are tips for using the resource efficiently?
4. Consider the level of detail in the abstracts. Do the abstracts include a sufficient amount of detail? Can the writer expand the abstracts in any way? (Remember that detailed statements are better than general ones.)

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Overall Guide

1.	Are the entries current and significant?
2.	Describe how the guide is formatted and organized. Is it “usable”?
3.	Comment on the style of the writing. Do the abstracts give specific information in efficient sentences?
4.	Where should the guide offer additional explanatory material or instructions to help the designated audience conduct online research?
5.	How does the guide relate specifically to the needs of the audience?
6.	What has the author done well in the guide? What needs work?
7.	Provide concrete suggestions for revision. Keep the evaluation/grading criteria in mind here.

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Cover Memo

1. Who is the letter addressed to? Is this an appropriate audience? Why?

2. Does the resume include the language (keywords, terms, etc.) from the job ad? Identify both places where it echoes the ad and places where it should echo the ad. 
3. How is the resume organized? You should be able to identify both logical and rhetorical organizing patterns. (Remember the difference? Logical patterns rely on basic organizations such as chronology; rhetorical pattern are more strategic, highlighting the most important elements of the resume.)  
4. How are the design elements appropriate for the audience’s needs, attitudes, and purposes? Does the design accommodate multiple audiences if it needs to? 
5. Look at issues of style. How does the writer employ language? For example, are the descriptions of job experience worded using action verbs? Are bulleted lists worded in parallel form? Is the resume free from errors in grammar, spelling, typography, and punctuation? Does the wording lend an appropriate ethos to the jobseeker?
6. What overall impression do you have of this job candidate as a writer, based on the resume? Recall that your first communication with an employer will likely be through your writing.

Prompts for Planning:

1. Brainstorm five processes or products with which you are familiar. Write a sentence definition for each one. Select the most promising topic.
2. Familiarize yourself with the process or product by reading about and/or working with it. Your goal should be to become expert enough to be able to write about the process or product. What might be challenging about describing this process or product?
3. Think about the context within which the audience might use the product or process. How might you tailor your description to fit their needs?
4. Which organizational pattern makes sense for your description? Outline the process or product description at a high level.
5. Where might visuals add clarity to your discussion?

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on responses to the planning prompts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of your Technical Description. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

1. Look at the title of the description. It should be sufficiently precise and informative. How does it achieve this goal? Rewrite the title if it does not achieve this goal. 
2. Look at the headings in the description. They should avoid long noun strings, be informative, and guide the reader. Describe how the headings fulfill or fail to fulfill these criteria. Are there places in the document where headings might be added?
3. Are there places in the document where the writer should employ lists? Where and why?
4. Look at paragraph coherence. Paragraphs should begin with a clear topic sentence, have adequate support, and use coherence devices (such as transitional words and phrases and repetition of key words). From a reader’s perspective, do you consider the paragraphs to be coherent? Suggest ways to revise paragraphs that are confusing or hard to follow. 
5. Judge the overall coherence of the description. In both large and small ways, is the description written in a coherent fashion? Does it use an appropriate organizational pattern? Suggest concrete revisions to improve coherence at all levels.
6. Descriptions are not instruction sets. Are there places in the description where the writer shifts into an instructional mode, giving step-by-step instructions for use rather than description of how a process or product works? If such places exist, suggest revisions that turn the instructional text into descriptive text.
