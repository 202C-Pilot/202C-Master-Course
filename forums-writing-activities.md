## Writing Workshop 4 - Project 2, Internet Resource Guide

Part One, Due Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your Internet Resource Guide.

The first step in drafting your Internet Resource Guide is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Guide, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goal of your response is to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more tends to be better, so don't hold back.

Prompts for Planning: 

1. Who is the audience for your Guide?
2. What problems of your audience might you address by preparing the Guide?
3. Under what conditions or circumstances might your audience use the Guide?
4. How might the use context affect the content and organization of the Guide?
5. How might your understanding of audience affect how you write the Guide?
6. What strategies might you use to motivate or appeal to your audience?
7. What might your audience already know or have experience in that you can build on?
8. At this point, what questions do you have about the project?

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on responses to the prompts.

Although document plans can be tentative and contingent, it's useful to workshop your ideas with peers, in order to get feedback on what you're thinking about doing and how you're imagining the document context. The following prompts invite you to respond to the planning work of peers. Your goal is to help peers clarify and elaborate their plans and consider aspects they might be overlooking. Be an active reviewer, with the goal of helping peers improve their plans and projects.

1. How would you describe the project and its context for your peer?
2. What are the strengths of the planning work? What did your peer do well?
3. What are the weaknesses of the planning work? What needs to be improved?
4. How, exactly, can your peer improve their planning? What concrete suggestions for improvement can you make?

## Writing Workshop 5
Part One, Due Friday: Draft Submission. Complete a draft of your Internet Resource Guide.

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on drafts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of the Front Matter, review of the Abstracts, and review of the Guide overall. You don't necessarily have to respond to each and every prompt, but you should respond, in one way or another, to a majority of them. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Front Matter

1.	Evaluate the Table of Contents. How many levels does it include? Are those levels adequate to support readers?
2.	Describe and analyze how the front matter discusses what's in the guide (contents/scope).
3.	Describe and analyze how the front matter attends to its audience and to the purposes for which it will be used. 
4.	What does the front matter assume that the user knows? Evaluate these assumptions. 
5.	What does the front matter say about how the guide is organized for use?
6.	Does the front matter discuss tips for using the guide efficiently? Can you suggest additional tips?
7.	Evaluate the development of the front matter. Which areas might need development or revision?
8.	How does the author distinguish between the different sections of the front matter?
9.	What could be added to the front matter to make the guide and its uses clearer to the intended audience?

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Abstracts

1. Evaluate the completeness of the abstracts. Are the draft abstracts complete? Do they include all identifying information (title, URL etc.)? Do they include this identifying information in a consistent way?
2. Describe the clarity of the content. Do the draft abstracts describe the resources so that readers will understand both their general function and their specific scope? (For example, your abstract on the index should tell both the purpose of the index and the range and dates of the periodicals covered.)
3. Return to the issue of completeness. Do the draft abstracts answer all four of the following questions sufficiently: What is this? What is in it (contents, scope)? How is that information relevant and useful for someone in my field? What are tips for using the resource efficiently?
4. Consider the level of detail in the abstracts. Do the abstracts include a sufficient amount of detail? Can the writer expand the abstracts in any way? (Remember that detailed statements are better than general ones.)

Prompts for Peer Feedback, Overall Guide

1.	Are the entries current and significant?
2.	Describe how the guide is formatted and organized. Is it “usable”?
3.	Comment on the style of the writing. Do the abstracts give specific information in efficient sentences?
4.	Where should the guide offer additional explanatory material or instructions to help the designated audience conduct online research?
5.	How does the guide relate specifically to the needs of the audience?
6.	What has the author done well in the guide? What needs work?
7.	Provide concrete suggestions for revision. Keep the evaluation/grading criteria in mind here.

## Writing Workshop 6

Due Friday, Project Reflection. Respond to the prompts for reflecting on your Internet Resource Guide.

An important step in finalizing any project is reflection. Reflection is a habit engaged in by professionals who are interested in improving their practices. You can't improve unless you think explicitly and formally about what you're doing.

Prompts for Reflection

1. How did the project go?
2. What did you learn from doing the project?
3. What areas of the project are you pleased with? Why?
4. What areas of the project could be improved? Why?
5. If you had a chance to start the project over, what would you do differently?

## Writing Workshop 10 - Project 4, Technical Description
Part One, Due Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your Technical Description.
The first step in drafting your Technical Description is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Technical Description, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goal of your response is to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more tends to be better, so don't hold back.

Prompts for Planning:

1. Brainstorm five processes or products with which you are familiar. Write a sentence definition for each one. Select the most promising topic.
2. Familiarize yourself with the process or product by reading about and/or working with it. Your goal should be to become expert enough to be able to write about the process or product. What might be challenging about describing this process or product?
3. Think about the context within which the audience might use the product or process. How might you tailor your description to fit their needs?
4. Which organizational pattern makes sense for your description? Outline the process or product description at a high level.
5. Where might visuals add clarity to your discussion?

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on responses to the prompts.

Although document plans can be tentative and contingent, it's useful to workshop your ideas with peers, in order to get feedback on what you're thinking about doing and how you're imagining the document context. The following prompts invite you to respond to the planning work of peers. Your goal is to help peers clarify and elaborate their plans and consider aspects they might be overlooking. Be an active reviewer, with the goal of helping peers improve their plans and projects.

1. How would you describe the project and its context for your peer?
2. What are the strengths of the planning work? What did your peer do well?
3. What are the weaknesses of the planning work? What needs to be improved?
4. How, exactly, can your peer improve their planning? What concrete suggestions for improvement can you make?

## Writing Workshop 11

Part One, Due Friday: Draft Submission. Complete a draft of your Technical Description.

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on drafts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of your Technical Description. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

1. Look at the title of the description. It should be sufficiently precise and informative. How does it achieve this goal? Rewrite the title if it does not achieve this goal. 
2. Look at the headings in the description. They should avoid long noun strings, be informative, and guide the reader. Describe how the headings fulfill or fail to fulfill these criteria. Are there places in the document where headings might be added?
3. Are there places in the document where the writer should employ lists? Where and why?
4. Look at paragraph coherence. Paragraphs should begin with a clear topic sentence, have adequate support, and use coherence devices (such as transitional words and phrases and repetition of key words). From a reader’s perspective, do you consider the paragraphs to be coherent? Suggest ways to revise paragraphs that are confusing or hard to follow. 
5. Judge the overall coherence of the description. In both large and small ways, is the description written in a coherent fashion? Does it use an appropriate organizational pattern? Suggest concrete revisions to improve coherence at all levels.
6. Descriptions are not instruction sets. Are there places in the description where the writer shifts into an instructional mode, giving step-by-step instructions for use rather than description of how a process or product works? If such places exist, suggest revisions that turn the instructional text into descriptive text.

Sunday, Project Due.

## Writing Workshop 13 - Project 5, Instruction Set
Part One, Due Friday: Planning Work. Respond to the prompts for planning your Instruction Set.

The first step in drafting your Instruction Set is planning. The following prompts ask you to write about your Instruction Set, including its audiences, purposes, contexts, contents, and constraints. The goal of your response is to help you begin to get a handle on what you're doing and to engender a conversation with your peers that can advance your thinking in productive ways. When it comes to planning, more tends to be better, so don't hold back.

1. What is the topic for your instruction set? What tasks will it cover?
2. Who is the audience? In what context will they be using your instructions?
3. How much experience do they have with the technology, tools, and materials needed for your instructions? What will you need to explain to them? 
4. If your instructions divide into tasks, what are the tasks for which you will provide directions? If your instructions divide into phases, what are the phases?
5. What equipment and/or supplies are needed to perform the instructions?
6. What warning, caution, and danger notices might these instructions require? 
7. What visuals (i.e., drawings, diagrams, schematics, photos) will be needed?

Part One, Due Friday: Draft Submission. Complete a draft of your Instruction Set.

Part Two, Due Sunday: Peer Feedback. Provide peer feedback on drafts.

An important step in drafting is peer feedback. The following prompts are for review of your Instruction Set. Don't be limited by these prompts, though: Share any and all feedback you have for your peers.

1. Review the introduction for the instruction set. It should describe the procedure, provide background information, and preview the contents and organization. How effective is the introduction? Is there anything missing that the audience would need before they start? What revisions could the author make to make the introduction more useful?
2. Locate key terms in the instruction set. List them below and evaluate whether or not the author has explained them. What terms might readers have trouble with?
3. How are the instructions organized? What is the overall organizational pattern? What organizational patterns are used within sections? How should the writer revise or reconsider the document’s organization?
4. What design techniques are used to help the audience find what they need? How does the author employ design principles? Evaluate the use of white space, columns, page grids, and other techniques to achieve an effective communication. 
5. How about the typography? Evaluate the effectiveness of typographical choices for the instruction set. Be sure to pay attention to all textual elements, including headings. 
6.	Identify the visual elements (diagrams, charts, tables, etc.). For what purposes are they used? Does the author need to revise their visuals or add additional visuals? 
7.	Are the instructions themselves worded clearly? That is, do they consistently use the imperative mood and parallelism? Are bullets and numbering used correctly? Suggest revisions of instructions that were unclear to you or that do not follow the standard format.
