## Writing Coherent Documents

Some of the chapters we've already read have introduced technical communication conventions such as titles, headings, lists, and document design. It is one thing to begin introducing these conventions to your writing, and another to use them in ways that improve the coherence of a document. This lesson focuses on how technical writing conventions can unify a document and make it easier for the audience to use.

The material in this lesson is likely to be new to you because it raises issues not covered in previous writing courses: document design, headings, and lists. These issues contribute to the overall coherence of a document, that is, the extent to which the parts of a document hold together and work together to create a unified, usable document. In a general sense, students are less practiced in revising for coherence than they are in revising for cohesion, which deals with sentence-level unity. However, you should find the material very useful. Overall coherence is especially hard to achieve in technical communication and so writers need strategies for building and establishing coherence.

Experienced writers understand the importance of a top-down approach to revising for coherence. Some students get so focused on revising sentence-level matters that they forget to examine the design and coherence of the whole document. Revising for coherence encourages you to keep your eye on big picture issues and avoid getting bogged down in relatively minor concerns (e.g. worrying over grammar during the drafting stage).

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* write coherent titles, headings, and lists;
* describe the difference between body paragraphs and transitional paragraphs;
* structure effective paragraphs by using a topic sentence followed by support;
* use coherence devices within and between paragraphs;
* revise documents using a top-down approach;
* recognize the value of headers, footers, and typography in enhancing coherence; and
* applying the strategies for coherence to your Technical Definition and Description assignment.
