## Project 3: Job Application Package

Most people obtain jobs through a multi-stage process. First you research the types of jobs you are qualified for and the types of employers you would like to work for. Then you try to convince specific employers to consider you for a job. These days, most employers have too many applicants per job to interview each personally. These employers sort through job application packages (resumes and cover letters) to decide which applicants to consider further. So your first communication with your future employer is likely to be in writing and must persuade him or her to continue the conversation.

For this assignment, you will write:

* Two cover letters addressed to different prospective employers and that apply for **two different** types of jobs. The letters should highlight different aspects of your experience relevant to the different jobs.

* Two resumes that may well differ significantly in content or in layout or both. The choices of content and layout should emphasize appropriate experience for each job.

* A cover memo addressed to me that overviews the two jobs, reviews what you know about these particular employers, and describes the strategies you have used to adapt your letter and resume to each situation. I expect you to make good use of the information in this memo in the arguments you present in your cover letters to the employers.


## Cover Memo

Write a brief memo (no more than two pages, single-spaced) addressed to me that will help me read, understand, evaluate, and “coach” your resumes and cover letters. For each of the two jobs, the memo must contain a separate job description and audience analysis, as well as a commentary highlighting how you adapted your resumes and cover letters to the different jobs. Since the memo will be of use to you in designing the rest of your job application package, you probably should think about it early—even begin drafting it early. It’s not due until the end, and you may not finish drafting it until after you’ve written the other parts of the assignment. Either way, you should look over it carefully at the very end of the project to make sure that it tells me “how to read” your resumes and cover letters.

**Job Description.** You may base your job description on job listings that you find in a professional or trade journal, on the Internet, or in other resources on campus at Career Services. The jobs should be different enough that you will have to emphasize different parts of your experience to qualify for the positions. You may also (with my permission) write for a summer job, an internship, or for a scholarship or other award. **Note that you must hand in copies of the job ads you use**.

**Audience Analysis.** Investigate the particular companies you are applying to. You may obtain information on companies from the library, on the Internet, from Career Services, or other places. You may also contact the personnel office of the company directly. Then write one or two paragraphs that specify any special qualities or experience that this company may be looking for in its employees. For example, suppose you are applying for a job as a chemical engineer. A small company may be looking for an engineer who can work on a variety of projects, while another may be looking specifically for someone who has experience with polymers. This is also the place to describe anything you know about the particular person you are writing to. I expect you to make extensive use of this information in your cover letter. It might also have a big impact on the organization and choice of details in your resume.

**Rhetorical Analysis.** Describe how you adapted each resume and cover letter for its particular type of job, company, and reader and why you made those changes. Normally, your reasons will be closely related to the information in the job description and audience analysis.


## Resume

The purpose of the resume is to describe your qualifications for a type of job. Since this assignment requires you to apply for two somewhat different jobs, you should create two somewhat different resumes.

**Content.** Your resume should include contact information and relevant details of your educational training, professional training, special accomplishments, and skills. But a resume is not a life history. The goal is to argue that you are qualified for a particular type of job and that you would be a capable, responsible, and personable employee who communicates effectively.

**Format.** Your format may be traditional or innovative as long as it is appropriate and as long as the information is highly accessible and is organized in a way that highlights the most important items—from the employer’s perspective.

**Style.** Your style should be fairly formal. You need not use complete sentences, but you should use a concise, active style and show consistency in expression from section to section.


## Cover Letter

While your resume is addressed to any employer with a certain type of job opening, the cover letter is most effective when tailored to a particular employer. The purpose of the cover letter is to persuade that specific employer to grant you an interview. Just as you appreciate being treated as an individual rather than as a statistic, so does an employer. Are you applying hit-or-miss to every company in the country? Or have you invested some effort into finding a company that you are well suited for?

**Content and Organization.** The opening of your letter should establish why you are writing to your reader. Be explicit about the fact that you are looking for a particular kind of job and explain why you would like to work at that particular company. Preview the body of the letter by stating your major qualifications for the job. The body of the letter develops each qualification with specific evidence. The goal is to show the reader both that you know what that specific company needs and that you have what it takes. You may organize this section in various ways: around your training and experience, around what the job or the company requires, or some other way. The letter should close by inviting a response.

**Style.** Cover letters are difficult to write because they aim at somewhat conflicting goals. On the one hand, you want to make a good first impression. So you want to sound polite and fairly formal. On the other hand, you want to stand out from the crowd—otherwise, why should the employer hire you rather than any of the other applicants? The best policy is probably to talk to your reader as directly and naturally as possible. Avoid hype.

**Format.** Use a conventional business letter format. Be brief: if possible, stick to one page.


## Standards for Correctness

Employers impose strict standards of correctness on application materials: An error is the equivalent of a bad spot on your shirt. Accordingly, I will mark this assignment on a somewhat stricter scale than usual. If any letter or resume contains more than two typographical or grammatical errors, I reserve the right to dock the entire package one letter grade. I will dock the package even more if there are numerous typographical or grammatical errors.


## Grading Criteria

Content, organization, format, style, correctness. And of course audience adaptation!
