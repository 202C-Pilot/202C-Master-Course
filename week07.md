## Preparing Job Application Materials

The job-application process involves planning a search, applying for positions, preparing for interviews, and writing follow-up correspondence. In planning a job search, it is important to do a self-inventory, learn about employers, prepare a résumé and job-application letter, and prepare a portfolio. An increasingly popular tool for job hunters is the electronic portfolio, a collection of materials including the applicant’s résumé and other samples of his or her work. You will not be preparing a portfolio for this course, but it's good to learn about what's involved in that process.

The typical resume and cover letter are often not ambitious enough for today's competitive job market. Many students think it sufficient to show that they have credentials for the job. If the ad calls for a degree in mechanical engineering, students will say they have one, but they don't elaborate on courses, assignments, and the like. The point should now be obvious: a lot of candidates are qualified for any position, but minimum qualifications will not ensure an interview. So we will spend class time reviewing sample resumes and cover letters, discussing how to persuasively present yourself as an applicant. We will also critique one another's work, trying to find areas of weakness as well as of strength.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

* plan an effective job search;
* describe the best ways to look for a position based on your field of study and experience level;
* design an effective resume and cover letter; and
* understand the job application process as a rhetorical process that involves presenting your background and work in particular ways. (There is, of course, more than one way to present yourself; you're looking for the best representation for a particular job.)
