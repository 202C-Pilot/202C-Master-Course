## Defining Technical Communication

Technical communication is the process of creating, shaping, and communicating technical information so that people can use it safely, effectively, and efficiently. It is created by technical professionals (engineers, scientists, businesspeople) and by technical communicators (full-time writers, editors, document-production people). Technical communication is essential in business and industry because virtually every action taken has to be communicated to subordinates or supervisors, or both, and has to be documented to provide a record for future reference.

Technical documents are addressed to particular readers, help those readers solve problems, are part of an organizational context, are often created collaboratively, use design to increase readability, and involve visuals. Effective technical communication is honest and ethical, clear, accurate, comprehensive, accessible, concise, professional in appearance, and correct.

* define technical communication and its role in your career;
